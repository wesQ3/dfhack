local help --[[
This script has a single function: to return a custom description for every
vanilla item in the game.

If "raw/scripts/item-descriptions.lua" exists, it will entirely replace this one.
Instead, mods should use "raw/scripts/more-item-descriptions.lua" to add content or replace
descriptions on a case-by-case basis.  If an item description cannot be found in
the latter script, view-item-info will fall back to the former.
